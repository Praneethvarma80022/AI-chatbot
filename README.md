# AI Chatbot using NLP

## Overview
This project is an AI-powered chatbot that utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to understand and respond to user queries. The chatbot is designed to provide intelligent and context-aware responses, making interactions more human-like.

## Features
- **Natural Language Understanding (NLU)**: Processes and interprets user queries.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Uses pre-trained NLP models for response generation.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, lemmatization, and stopword removal.
- **Customizable Responses**: Ability to train with new datasets.
- **Scalable and Modular**: Easily extendable for new use cases.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries & Frameworks**:
  - TensorFlow/Keras
  - NLTK / SpaCy
  - Transformers (Hugging Face)
  - Flask (for API Deployment)
  - OpenAI GPT (optional for advanced responses)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Praneethvarma80022/AI-chatbot.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd AI-chatbot
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv chatbot_env
   source chatbot_env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `chatbot_env\Scripts\activate`
   ```
4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
Run the chatbot locally:
```bash
python chatbot.py
```

For a web-based chatbot, start the Flask server:
```bash
python app.py
```
Then access the chatbot via `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## Example Interaction
```
User: Hello!
Chatbot: Hi! How can I assist you today?

User: What is AI?
Chatbot: AI stands for Artificial Intelligence, which enables machines to learn and perform tasks that typically require human intelligence.
```
